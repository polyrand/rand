# Education before innovation

We live in a fast changing world, everyone seems to be working on the next big thing while you still haven't got used to the previous big thing. We look at technology, science and innovation as our new saving god, while overlooking something more fundamental: education.

It seems we just want to solve everything with technology and new discoveries: travelling, diseases, waiting times to visit a doctor, etc. I believe many of those things could be alleviated with a better education instead of throwing money and headlines at the next company trying to solve it.

I am not saying that part is not necessary, I think it's more needed than ever before, and companies trying to improve our society should be praised for that, but; teaching people what symptoms need to be really checked and teaching how to have a good life style (diet, exercise, meditation...) would have an infinitely bigger impact on healthcare and waiting times that creating the best management app for a hospital; teaching why recycling is important, why riding your bike can be faster and more convenient than your car or why you don't need to renew your wardrobe every year would have a bigger impact on the environment than most of the current "high-tech" solutions.

Improving artificial intelligence is fantastic, but lets not forget to improve our society intelligence.
