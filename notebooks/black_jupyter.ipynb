    "First of all I must admit these tips may be biased by the fact I use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) quite a lot. I think they are an incredible tool for learning although they may also instill some bad coding habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before talking about [black](https://github.com/psf/black) lets go through the step to install it and use it with Jupyter Notebooks.\n",

    "## Installing black and using it with Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for us, there is a Jupyterlab [extension](https://github.com/ryantam626/jupyterlab_code_formatter) for code formatting. To get started you only need 4 commands if you are using **conda**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge black\n",
    "jupyter labextension install @ryantam626/jupyterlab_code_formatter\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab_code_formatter\n",
    "jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab_code_formatter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using **pip** you need to install the one of the supported formatters (black in this case) and then do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter labextension install @ryantam626/jupyterlab_code_formatter\n",
    "pip install jupyterlab_code_formatter\n",
    "jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab_code_formatter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, what really helps me using black continuously, is having a handy shortcut to run it in the current cell. In my case I use **ctrl + k**, you can add it to your jupyterlab shortcuts pasting the following in your shortcuts settings editor:\n",
