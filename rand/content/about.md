My name is Ricardo Ander-Egg Aguilar. I am a medical doctor working as 
a sofware engineer and machine learning developer. I currently live in Barcelona.

I really love programming, maths, statistics and thinking about how current
problems can be solved.

Regarding my other interests, I have been a swimmer for 15 years, sport is just
a part of me. I love hiking and travelling, I am also a salsa dancer and when I
have some spare time I edit travel videos, which you can check on my [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTFsATphcCIZ14BZanJ_tMA).
