## Introduction

When I was 18 I wanted to do research on genetics. I was wondering wheter to study medicine or going for something more especialized on the topic like biomedicine or biochemistry. Having one of the best medicine faculties in my hometown, plus a few other factors made me get into medicine.

During my first years I tried hard to get hands on experience with some teachers. For a couple of summers I did some practice at a neurophysiology laboratory. As time went by I noticed that was not what I wanted to do full time. I love research because it is an act of **creation**, but I did not like academic life. The **feedback loops** were also really long and slow, sometimes imprecise. With time I lost interest in that type of research, not in **creation**.

Some time later I became a self-taught software engineer.

Thinking about software and medicine gave me many ideas to write. I read a [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23590111) on HackerNews comparing CS to medicine. That pushed me to write this.

## Knowledge acquisition

The first and most important difference is knowledge acquisition. How many self-taught software developers have you heard of? Probably quite a lot. Also, being selft-taught does not seem to reduce your chances of being a succesful developer, whatever successful developer means to you. Now, how many self-taught medical doctors have you heard of? Let me guess, not that many. This illustrates one difference between both fields.

Most of the theoretical knowledge you get is "useless". Practice puts that knowledge inside your nervous system. That is what sets computer science and medicine appart. One of them only needs an internet connection. The other requires access to a hospital with real patients, as well as a more knowledgeable doctor teaching and guiding you. You can read all the medicine books in the world, but it won't matter if you have never seen an illness in real life. Just like reading about binary trees won't teach you until you get your hands on the keyboard (or at least a pencil on paper).

I think this applies to other highly theoretical carrers like law. I would not trust a lawyer with absolutely zero experience, no matter how many books she has read [1].

Another difference lies on history. Even though computer science moves  really fast, it is relatively new. On the other hand, medicine has always existed. We have always cared about our health. That makes medicine a huge field. It is true most of the useful knowledge in medicine is relatively new, but it stands on the previous knowledge. That is why in medicine you need to have such an especialization. You become and ophthalmologist, cardiologist, lung surgeon, etc [2].

## Feedback loops

Feedback loops make computer science very attractive. Consider research in genetics. The time between starting an experiment and seeing the result can be quite long. And that does not even mean the experiment has gone well. Now take computer science. A couple of keystrokes tell you if your program runs, the output is instant [3].

Let's merge this with **creation**. Science research is creation, taking care of a patient is creation [4], developing twitter from zero is creation. The differences between those three examples are a few, but feedback loops stand out. 

## Levels of abstraction

Medicine: you see it (human body, blood, disease)
CS: you imagine it before seeing (dag, function, array, thread, binary file...)

Learning to program is learning a mental model (https://selectstarsql.com/frontmatter.html)

## Impact

## Notes

* [1]: For law and medicine you can always sit down with a book in the face of a new case and with effort and time you might get through it. But that's not what you would  expect from someone who call themselves ...
* [2]: Yes, you have general practitioners and internal medicine, but...
* [3]: The output may not be instant if you are trying to build a big platform. But that huge piece of software will be decomposed in functions in its essence, and there is where you can get instant feedback. Creating a new drug can be decomposed as taking simpler (steps) too, but the scale still applies.
* [4]: We could say we are "creating" health. The means to doing that is our knowledge on the human body, physiology and chemistry.
