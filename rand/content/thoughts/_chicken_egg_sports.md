I grew up with sports. The first time I got into a swimming pool was short after being born. When I was 3 I started swimming. At 8 I was doing competitive swimmig.

The training has not always been the same, it all starts like "something else you do apart from school". When I was 14 there was a huge change (reserved for a different blog post). From then until I was 23 I never stopped training for competitions. Training becomes part of yourself. Even if I got out of competitions I train every day. Gym, swimming or running. Training is addictive and there's no option of "not doing any sports".

When we are all 14, it is harder to notice who does or does not train hard. But at times goes on, nature does it job. This post comes from a statment many of us may have heard or even said:

*I can't do X because Y*. Where *Y* is in part happening because you don't do *X*.

For sports that would be things like: *I can't lift heavy weights because my back hurts*, *I can't go running because I have pain in my knees*, etc. Those statments woudl be probably true, but here is where "the chicken or the egg dilemma" comes in. You can't lift weights because it hurts, or does it hurt because you have never really taken care fo your body?

I get it's hard. It is fucking hard. I understand it is not easy to do something that causes suffering and you need to learn to enjoy that suffering. But the fact is sarcopenia (lack of muscle) is onw of the major causes of frailty. This shows up more in older people.

School



Not only about looking good in the mirror.



Start slow, as slow as you need.
