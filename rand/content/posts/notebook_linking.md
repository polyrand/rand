There is a little trick I just found about, which I think can be very useful when you split tasks across different notebooks.

Jupyter notebooks keep gaining popularity and use cases, the rapid growth of the tooling ecosystem around it is just one proof (for example [voil√†](https://github.com/QuantStack/voila) or [panel](https://panel.pyviz.org/)).

Most people choose Jupyter when publishing a course or tutorial on Github and that's great, but wheen there are a lot of notebooks it can become messy.

I am now working on a project and I'm separating tasks in different notebooks like:

```markdown
01.task1.ipynb
02.task2.ipynb
03.task3.ipynb
.
.
.
```

And I found you can link a notebook from another one like you would link to a normal website:

```markdown

[task foo](../notebooks/02.task2.ipynb)
```

Even though this is something very simple, I think it can be useful at work or if you are distributing a book as Jupyter notebooks and need to refer to a previous notebook/chapter. This way you are only one click away and don't need to llok for it!
