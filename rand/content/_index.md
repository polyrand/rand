Hello there! I'm Ricardo, medical doctor and self-taught software engineer. I work on machine learning and software engineering projects. I'm also a swimmer and dancer.

I'm interested in working towards integrating new tools into the healthcare ecosystem, to accelerate accurate diagnosis and improve the patient's experience.
You can see my projects in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/polyrand), read my [blog](https://ricardoanderegg.com/posts/) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardoanderegg/).
I am also very active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ricardoanderegg).

* [Think](https://ricardoanderegg.com/thoughts/): Blog posts related to education, medicine, life, sports or whatever comes to my mind.
